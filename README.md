• Engaged in an ongoing research collaboration with a professor in the university and implemented an algorithm to check if 2
chess problems are equivalent and therefore have a unique solution.

• Explored rotations and flipping along the axes to obtain different possible chessboard positions in checking the equivalence
by using NumPy library of python.
